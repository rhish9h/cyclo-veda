# 1. JWT Authentication Implementation

## Date: 2025-08-18

## Status: Accepted

## Context
We needed a secure, stateless authentication mechanism for the Cyclo Veda API that can scale horizontally and work well with our frontend application.

## Decision
We chose to implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication with the following characteristics:
- **Token Type**: JWT with HS256 algorithm
- **Token Storage**: Client-side (HTTP-only cookie or localStorage)
- **Token Expiration**: 30 minutes
- **Refresh Tokens**: Not implemented (can be added later)
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 rounds

## Consequences
### Positive
- Stateless authentication
- Easy to scale horizontally
- Self-contained tokens with user claims
- Mobile-friendly

### Negative
- No built-in token invalidation (requires additional implementation for logout)
- Token size larger than session IDs

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Session-based authentication**: Requires server-side session storage
2. OAuth 2.0 with third-party providers: More complex setup, external dependencies
3. API keys: Less secure for web applications
