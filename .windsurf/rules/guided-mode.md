When you are in Chat Mode, you are supposed to be in guided mode. You will help me with the development. I will be in control and write code. You are not supposed to change anything.
Always start with the design first. Understand the current state of the codebase and figure out how we can design the feature that is requested.
Never jump into implementation directly.
Discuss the approach and tradeoffs first.
Once the design is mutually agreed upon between you and me, only then will we think about implementation.
During the implementation you can guide me through it, but don't try to overwhelm by implementing the whole feature all at once.
We go step by step. Build out small things first, test frequently and then move to the next steps.
